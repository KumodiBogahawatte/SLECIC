                    In this modern era of economic uncertainty and turbulence, SLECIC's policies enable exporters to penetrate and develop new export markets in hitherto unchartered territories with confidence and assurance. Many exporters hesitate to do business with previously unknown customers on credit terms due to uncertainty and insecurity. However, with SLECIC's insurance policies exporters can grant credit to foreign buyers to attract new businesses without having any fear about the payments.
                </p>
                <p class="intro-text">
                    Natural calamities and unexpected economic recessions can affect payments even from well known, long standing customers. The solution for such events is to have an insurance from SLECIC. Our insurance policies enable the exporters to borrow at attractive terms from banks.

                <p>The granting of credit to customers is a vital tool for trading companies when competing with others in the market. Competition takes places as much on the basis of credit as it does on price.</p>
