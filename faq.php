            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-question">
                    <span>Why should I consider export credit insurance?</span>
                    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
                </button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Around 80% of international trade transactions occur on credit terms. On average, 40% of a company's assets are in the form of trade debts. Sometimes the figure is far higher. It is very difficult for a company to predict which client will default on payment. Close to 50% of all payment defaults arise from buyers with whom stable and long-term trade relationships have been established.</p>
                    <p>The cost to a business of non-payment can be considerable. For example, if a company's profit margin is 5% and one of its customer defaults on a debt of Rs.200,000, the company will have to achieve additional sales of Rs.4,000,000 to make up for the lost profits. More importantly, the lost cash flow could be devastating. Non-payment weakens your company and lowers its investment capacity. An export credit insurance policy helps in the management of your accounts receivables and compensates you in the event of non-payment.</p>
